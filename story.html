            <h3>When Our Eyes First Met 👀❤️</h3>
            <p>29th May, 2019… when we first saw each other at a wedding. Her eyes first fell on me… and soon
              after, mine started noticing her. Our conversations were only through our eyes… though maybe both of us
              wanted to talk, but it didn’t happen.. We also took quite a few pictures of her… and then she gave her
              number saying, ‘Send me the pics.’ my happiness at that moment was priceless. That was just the
              first part…
            </p><br>

            <p>
              Now, a few days after the wedding, I sent a ‘Hi’ on WhatsApp, and she replied, ‘Hello, how are you?’ — you
              can imagine, my day was made… and she was really happy too. That’s how our chats started… making her
              laugh, flirting, caring for her… all of this she started liking. Somewhere along the way, she fell in love
              with me, and maybe I with her too… and finally, the day came when…</p>

            <h3>She Said Yes 💍</h3>
            <p>Then came the moment I proposed to her… without thinking twice, she said ‘Yes.’ It felt like I had
              received everything in the world. My happiness was soaring in the seventh heaven. I was happy all day
              long. Late-night chats, waking up to her ‘Good morning,’ saying ‘Good night’ at night, hearing ‘Love you’
              — I had never felt anything like this before. Day and night passed by without me realizing, yet we were
              having countless conversations… but we still hadn’t met in person.
            </p><br>

            <p>
              One day, we finally planned to meet. She lived in Lucknow, and I went there to see her. I was so nervous
              beforehand; I had never met a girl like this before. When I arrived, she was already waiting for me. The
              moment I saw her, my eyes were fixed on her… she looked so beautiful. I couldn’t meet her gaze at first,
              but she looked so confident. After a while, I calmed down.
            </p><br>

            <p>
              We talked a lot, held hands, took selfies… it felt like this moment would never end. That was our very
              first meeting, my love, and it was truly unforgettable.</p>

            <h3>Our Noida Chapter 💕</h3>
            <p>She’s a medical student and now lives in Prayagraj. One day, she decided to come to Noida, just to see
              me. When I heard she was coming, my heart leapt with joy. She was traveling all that distance just for us.
              She booked her bus ticket — her journey began at 8 PM that night.
            </p><br>
            <p>
              As she traveled, we kept talking — where she had reached, how long it would take… and I couldn’t stop
              imagining that by this time tomorrow, she would be in my arms. It was our first time staying together like
              this, and she was coming for three whole days. Even during the bus ride, she was chatting with me, her
              excitement matching mine. I was thrilled, thinking about the next morning — waking up with her, sharing my
              morning tea together, feeling her presence beside me. Every detail, I had imagined it all.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              I had made my flat perfectly ready, every little corner waiting for her. Even now, I still can’t believe
              that she was going to stay with me for two nights, like my very own wife. The next morning, she reached
              Noida and called me, asking me to come pick her up. My heart raced at the thought of seeing her face and
              holding her hand in just a few minutes.</p><br>
            <p>
              I turned up, and there she was, standing on the road, waiting for me. When I reached her, she grasped my
              hand tightly, and together, we walked towards my flat. My heart was full, my mind spinning — every step
              with her felt magical.

              What happened next… well, that’s a story for the next slide.</p>

            <h3>The most beautiful 3 days of my life ❤️</h3>
            <p>Finally, we reached the flat. My younger brother was ready to welcome his ‘bhabhi.’ As soon as we
              entered, he touched her feet and asked, ‘Kaise ho aap?’ She smiled and said, ‘Main bahut achhi hoon.’ I
              took her to the room, she kept her luggage, and I told her to rest. After some time, she got ready and
              started preparing white sauce pasta with my brother and me helping a little. Watching her cook, I felt
              like she was my very own wife — it was the sweetest feeling. When the pasta was ready, we all sat to eat,
              and I swear, it was the most delicious pasta I had ever tasted.
            </p><br>

            <p>
              By afternoon, my brother went to the hall, leaving just the two of us in the room. We spent some private
              moments together; it felt truly magical. Later, I took a short nap, and when I woke up, she came to me,
              wrapped me in a tight hug, and softly asked, ‘Chai bnaun aapke liye?’ I smiled and said yes. The chai she
              made was pure magic — just like her. I honestly have no words. In those moments, I felt like I was living
              my real life, the happiest and most peaceful I had ever known.
            </p><br>

            <p>
              The next morning, she woke up early and asked, ‘Kya khaoge aaj?’ She cooked every meal with so much love
              and thoughtfulness
              — poha, pakode, saahi mashroom everything felt special. She made me feel the love and care I had never felt before. Those
              moments with
              her were precious</p><br>
            <p>
              But when her last day came, my heart sank. Her bus to Prayagraj was at night, and as time passed, tears
              filled our eyes. We visited the temple together, had tea, and then she started packing. Her head rested on
              my shoulder, crying softly, saying, ‘Mujhe aapko chhod ke nahi jana.’ I held back my tears, whispering,
              ‘Rote nahi, beta, jaldi hi milenge.’ Finally, we booked the cab, reached her bus, and with watery eyes,
              bid her goodbye.
            </p><br>
            <p>
              Those three days were the most beautiful of my life, filled with love, care, laughter, and unforgettable
              memories. The ending was emotional, but the moments we shared will stay with me forever.
